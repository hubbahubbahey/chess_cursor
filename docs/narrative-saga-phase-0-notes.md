# Narrative Saga Phase 0 Notes

Purpose: capture Phase 0 decisions so they are visible in the repo.

## Decisions
- Saga length + output modes: 5 Acts + Closing Reflection; Full/Condensed/One-Line.
- Input policy: PGN-only; no engine evals, alternative moves, or suggestions.
- Schema/template alignment: reviewed against renderer targets; no gaps found.

## Artifacts
- docs/narrative-saga-contract.md (authoritative contract + schema)
- docs/narrative-saga-jira-board.md (planning reference)

## Next Actions
- Keep Phase 1 tasks aligned with the contract schema and renderer targets.
- Update this note if the schema or renderer targets change.
